# A Few Disclaimers first
I, in no way, had any part in creating or contributing to these mods. You should give thanks to the original creaters for their hard work and dedication, and to Nintendo for creating the games. All I did was compile all these mods into one easy to get location.
I've tried reaching out to a few of the mod creators and most of them have since move on in life and are no longer reachable. 
If you are one of the Mod creators and don't like me redistributing your work, just let me know and I'll have it removed.
