# Metroid Prime Trilogy Fanmade Remaster

This does not include a copy of the game. Please refer to this guide on how to get your own copy (https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/ripping-games/).

This mod Compilation is for the Wii version "Metroid Prime Trilogy" and is not setup for the gamecube versions.

# A Few Disclaimers first
I, in no way, had any part in creating or contributing to these mods. You should give thanks to the original creaters for their hard work and dedication, and to Nintendo for creating the games. All I did was compile all these mods into one easy to get location.
I've tried reaching out to a few of the mod creators and most of them have since move on in life and are no longer reachable. 
If you are one of the Mod creators and don't like me redistributing your work, just let me know and I'll have it removed.


# Description
I've always enjoyed the Metroid Prime series and hope to someday see Nintendo make an official remaster of the trilogy. They are amazing games with fantastic gameplay, even to this day. But to be a bit honest, they are starting to look and feel a bit outdated. Playing the gamecube version, your limited to the one analog. And playing the Wii version, unless your one of the very few people who have a wii remote and a sensor bar setup, is a pain in the butt to get working comfortably. So I setout to modernize this as much as I could.

This originally was just going to be for my personal use but I figured, why not share my results for everyone else to benefit as well. I've made this as easy as I possible could to get setup. Between all the mods I've used, the game now has modernized controls, pretty much all textures upscaled, upscaled UI, Mouse and Keyboard support, Preconfigured Input Setups, and proper input icons! The only thing you need to provide is a copy of the game.

# Getting Started
1.  Download the compilation from the link above.
2.  Unzip the file.
3.  Launch Dolphin.exe
4.  Go to Options>Configurations>Paths and add your Metroid Prime Trilogy game path
5.  Go to Options>Controller Settings>Metroid (Wii Remote) and choose your input device and configuration (I have three preset configurations that you can use, or you can make your own).
6.  Enjoy the game

Optional steps If you want to launch directly into the game. Only do these after you completed the previous steps.

7.  Launch Metroid Prime Trilogy Remastered.exe
8.  Add your Metroid Prime Trilogy game path
9.  Choose to use the application to directly launch into the game

Now every time you launch the Metroid Prime Trilogy Remastered.exe it will skip the lanucher and take you right into the game.

I had set everything to what I believe would be "medium" settings, so depending on your setup, you may be able to increase setting evens higher. 


# Input Mapping

Controller Mapping

These are my personal input mappings, so if you don't like it feel free to adjust these to your personal preferance. Because of the Universal Dynamic Input mod, it will still show the correct button icons even if you change it.

# Final Notes
After doing all this I didn't feel like taking any comparison screenshots so if any of you would like to do so, send them to me and I will include the shots and credit you for them.

If you have any issues, please open an issue and either Me or someone else will look into it and try to fix it.

If anyone knows of any other mods that could even better improve this, please let me know and I'll look into it.
